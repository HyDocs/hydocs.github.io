**The ultimate index for Hypixel and Minecraft junkies.** HyDocs is a community-driven wiki built to help you navigate the massive world of Hypixel. Whether you're looking for the best SkyBlock mods, a decent PvP texture pack, or the latest Bazaar trackers, we’ve got it indexed.

If this helps you out, consider dropping a ⭐ **star** on the repo. It keeps us motivated to hunt down more resources!

## 📩 Suggesting a Link

Got a cool tool, mod, or site that isn't here? We want to see it!

### ⛔ Things we won't add:

1.  **Cheats/Hacks:** No "Blacklisted" modifications or anything that gets you banned on Hypixel.
2.  **Ratting/Phishing:** We manually check every link. If it smells like a session stealer, it's gone.
3.  **Low Effort:** Sites that just copy-paste from SkyCrypt or the Official Wiki without adding value.
4.  **Heavy Paywalls:** If the tool costs $50 just to see your own stats, we're skipping it.
5.  **Small/Dead Projects:** We try to index things that are actually maintained.

### ⚠️ We try to avoid:

- **Closed Source Mods:** We heavily prefer FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) for security reasons.
- **Sketchy Hosting:** If a mod is only hosted on a random Discord or a fast-expiring file hoster.
