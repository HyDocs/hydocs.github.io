# Safety Guide

Account security is paramount in Hypixel SkyBlock. One mistake can lose thousands of hours of progress.

## The Golden Rules

1.  **NEVER give your Microsoft Code**: If a "Microsoft Verification" asks for a code sent to your email, it is a scam.
2.  **Mod Safety**: Only download mods from official GitHubs or Modrinth.
3.  **Session IDs**: Never upload your log files (`latest.log`) to random Discord servers/users. They contain your session ID which allows bypassing 2FA.

## 2-Factor Authentication

Ensure your Microsoft Account has 2FA enabled with an Authenticator App (not just SMS).

::: danger 'Friends'
Scammers often impersonate friends or trusted community members. If a friend asks you to test a mod, verify it's really them via another platform first.
