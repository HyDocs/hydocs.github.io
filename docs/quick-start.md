## Part 1: Getting started: Minecraft & Hypixel

Minecraft is a game with endless creative freedom. It is so vast that there are community creations such as Hypixel, which is our main focus for creating this guide.

### 1.1 Buy Minecraft & create an account

- Visit **Minecraft.net** to purchase **Minecraft: Java Edition** (Hypixel runs on Java Edition): https://www.minecraft.net/
- If you don't already have one, **create a Microsoft/Xbox account** (this is required for Java accounts since migration).

::: tip **Security tip:**
Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Microsoft account and use a strong unique password. See our **Safety Guide** for more details: [Safety Guide](/glossary/safety).
:::

### 1.2 Install the launcher and log in

- Download the [Prism Client (Recommended)](https://prismlauncher.org/) OR The official [Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download) from the site, install it, and log in with your Microsoft account.
- Choose the **Java Edition** and select a version to play.

::: info Note
Many popular Skyblock mods use **1.21+** (Modern), while competitive PvP usually uses **1.8.9**. Choose the version compatible with your goals.
:::

### 1.3 Join Hypixel

- Open Minecraft → **Multiplayer** → **Add Server**.
- Server Address: `mc.hypixel.net` and press **Join Server**.
- Read the server rules and **do not share your login** or API keys with others.

### 1.4 First steps in-game

- Try short matches first (e.g., Bedwars or SkyWars) to get used to the gameplay and chat.
- If you want a longer progression experience, try **SkyBlock**, it’s a good place to learn economy & progression mechanics.

### 1.5 After you join: mods, clients, and help

- If you'd like improved performance or QoL features, check the **Client & Mods** section or specific pages like [Essential Mod](/mods/essential).
- Have questions? Check the [FAQ](/faq) or the [Safety Guide](/glossary/safety).
