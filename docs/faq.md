## General

### What is HyDocs?

HyDocs is a community-driven index designed to help players find safe mods, useful tools, and reliable resources for Hypixel and Minecraft. We manually vet every link to ensure the community stays safe.

### Is this site affiliated with Hypixel?

No. HyDocs is a fan project and is not affiliated with Hypixel Inc. or Mojang AB.

### How do I suggest a new resource?

You can use the **Feedback** button on the site or open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HyDocs/hydocs.github.io).

## Security & Mods

### What is "Ratting"?

"Ratting" is a term used in the Minecraft community for session ID stealing. If you download a malicious mod or click a fake verification link, hackers can steal your login token and empty your SkyBlock profiles. Check our [Safety Guide](/glossary/safety) to stay protected.

### Are the mods on this site safe to use?

While we only index reputable sources like Modrinth, CurseForge, and official GitHub repos, you should always use caution. Stick to well-known mods and never download `.jar` files from random Discord DMs.

### Will these mods get me banned?

Most mods listed here are "Quality of Life" (QoL) and fall under the "Use at your own risk" category. We avoid indexing anything that provides an unfair advantage (cheats/hacks).

## Technical

### Why is my game lagging?

Lag can be either "Server Lag" (Hypixel's end) or "Client Lag" (your PC). Check our [Guides](/guides) to optimize your FPS and network settings.
